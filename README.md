Instructions on how to run the models:
First, URO 1, URO 2 and URO 3 need to be run individually on OxCal. The resulting modelled dates for Bark Edges and the Uronarti Foundation boundary should be saved as a prior and inserted into the MK models separately.
The model for the Senusret III BOAT felling date can be found in the following reference:	
S. W. Manning, et al, High-precision dendro-14C dating of two cedar wood sequences from First Intermediate Period and Middle Kingdom Egypt and a small regional climate-related 14C divergence. Journal of Archaeological Science 46, 401â€“416 (2014).
The date for 'Felling Date' from this model also needs to be saved as a prior and inserted into the MK models separately.
